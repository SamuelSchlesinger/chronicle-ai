### Turn 1

**Player:** I cautiously walk down the forest path, keeping my hand on my axe.

**DM:** You move carefully along the winding forest path, your boots crunching softly on fallen leaves. The morning sun filters through the dense canopy above, casting shifting patterns of light and shadow across the worn dirt trail. Your hand rests reassuringly on the handle of your battleaxe - a soldier's instinct that has served you well.

The forest is alive with the sounds of chirping birds and rustling branches, but something feels... off. The hair on the back of your neck prickles with that familiar battlefield awareness that kept you alive during your military service.
Your trained eye catches movement in the underbrush ahead - the glint of crude metal and the telltale rustle of something trying too hard to stay hidden. Three figures crouch behind fallen logs and thick brambles about thirty feet down the path, poorly concealed and clearly waiting for unwary travelers.

From their small stature and the way they grip their weapons, you recognize them immediately: goblins. Their yellow eyes gleam with malicious intent as they prepare to spring their ambush, unaware that you've spotted them first.

You have the advantage of surprise. The path continues straight ahead where they're waiting, but you notice thick trees on both sides that could provide cover. Your military training kicks in - you could charge them while they're unprepared, try to sneak closer for a better position, or call out a challenge.

What do you do?

### Turn 2

**Player:** I stop and listen carefully. Is something moving in the bushes?

**DM:** You pause on the forest path, straining your ears and focusing intently on the sounds around you. The natural symphony of the forest continues - birds calling, leaves rustling in the gentle breeze, the distant sound of a woodpecker hammering against bark.

But as you concentrate, trying to pick out anything unusual, the ambient forest noise seems to overwhelm your senses. A squirrel chatters loudly in a nearby oak, masking other sounds. The wind picks up just as you think you hear something, causing branches to creak and leaves to whisper overhead.

Your soldier's intuition still tells you something isn't quite right about this stretch of path, but you can't pinpoint exactly what has you on edge. The feeling of being watched persists, that prickly sensation between your shoulder blades that every veteran knows, but you can't identify the source.

The path ahead looks peaceful enough - just more forest trail winding between the trees. Yet your hand remains on your axe handle, your body tense with readiness.

Do you continue forward cautiously, investigate the areas that caught your attention earlier, or take a different approach?

### Turn 3

**Player:** I draw my axe and call out: 'Show yourselves, cowards!'

**DM:** You draw your battleaxe from your belt with a practiced motion, the familiar weight settling into your grip. Your voice booms through the forest with the commanding authority of a seasoned soldier: **"Show yourselves, cowards!"**

Your challenge echoes off the trees, and for a heartbeat, the forest falls silent. Then, with startled yelps and the crash of breaking branches, three goblins burst from their hiding spots!

The first goblin scrambles over a fallen log, its rusty scimitar gleaming as it shrieks in its harsh tongue. The second emerges from behind a thick oak tree, clutching a crude shortbow with an arrow already nocked. The third springs from a bramble thicket, leaves and twigs caught in its matted hair, wielding a wicked-looking scimitar.

All three are snarling with rage at having their ambush spoiled, their yellow eyes blazing with fury. They're small but vicious, typical goblin raiders looking for easy prey on the forest roads.

**INITIATIVE ORDER:**
- **Goblin 2** (Initiative 18)
- **Goblin 1** (Initiative 16) 
- **Kira Stonefist** (Initiative 12)
- **Goblin 3** (Initiative 10)

**Round 1 begins!**

---

**Goblin 2's turn:** The archer goblin immediately draws back its bowstring and fires at you!
The arrow whistles through the air and strikes you in the shoulder! **6 piercing damage!**
**Goblin 1's turn:** The first goblin charges at you with its scimitar raised, shrieking a battle cry!
The curved blade slashes across your arm! **4 slashing damage!**
**Your turn, Kira!** You're badly wounded (3/13 HP) but still standing, axe in hand. The goblins are close - one right in front of you with a bloody scimitar, another with a bow about 20 feet away, and the third goblin is moving to flank you.

You can attack the goblin right in front of you, try to charge the archer, or use your Second Wind ability to recover some health. What do you do?

*[Combat: HP 3/13, Player's turn: false]*

### Turn 4

**Player:** I charge at the nearest goblin with a battle cry!

**DM:** With a fierce dwarven war cry that echoes through the trees, you surge forward despite your wounds, battleaxe raised high! The goblin's eyes widen in terror as you bear down on it with the fury of a seasoned warrior!
Your battleaxe swings in a mighty arc, but the nimble goblin ducks at the last second! The heavy blade whistles through empty air, your momentum carrying you slightly off balance as the goblin scrambles backward with a chittering laugh.

"Stupid dwarf too slow!" it taunts in broken Common, brandishing its scimitar.
Wait - I need to correct the initiative order. Let me check the current combat state.
**Goblin 3's turn:** The third goblin rushes in from your flank, trying to take advantage of your missed swing!
The flanking goblin's scimitar finds its mark, slashing across your leg!
The goblin's blade bites deep into your thigh! The combined wounds from the ambush prove too much - darkness creeps in at the edges of your vision as you collapse to the forest floor, your battleaxe falling from nerveless fingers.

**You are unconscious and dying!** Blood seeps into the fallen leaves beneath you as the goblins cackle with glee, thinking they've claimed another victim.
**Round 2 begins!**

**Your turn:** You're unconscious at 0 HP and must make a death saving throw at the start of your turn!
Your breathing grows shallower as your life force ebbs away. The goblins' voices seem distant, echoing as if from the bottom of a well. You're teetering on the edge of death itself.

**Death Save Status: 0 successes, 1 failure** (2 more failures = death, 3 successes = stable)

The goblins are now debating whether to finish you off or search your belongings first...

*[Combat: HP 0/13, Player's turn: false]*

### Turn 5

**Player:** I swing my axe at the goblin in a wide arc.

**DM:** You try to swing your axe, but your body won't respond. You're unconscious at 0 hit points, collapsed on the forest floor with blood pooling beneath you. Your battleaxe lies just out of reach where it fell from your hands.

The only thing you can do right now is cling to life and hope the death saving throw goes in your favor. Your consciousness flickers like a dying candle as the goblins chatter excitedly over your fallen form.

You cannot take any actions while unconscious - no attacks, no movement, nothing. The darkness presses in around you as your life hangs by a thread.

The goblins are still deciding your fate. Will you survive this brush with death, or will the forest claim another victim?

*[Combat: HP 0/13, Player's turn: false]*

---

### Turn 6

**Player:** I try to kick the goblin away and look for others.

**DM:** You're unconscious and cannot act. Your body lies motionless on the forest floor, blood seeping from your wounds into the fallen leaves. You cannot kick, look around, or take any actions while unconscious at 0 hit points.

The world exists only as distant, muffled sounds - the goblins' chittering voices, the rustle of leaves, your own shallow breathing. Your battleaxe lies where it fell, just beyond your reach.

You must make a death saving throw to see if you can cling to life. Three successes will stabilize you, but three failures mean death.

The goblins continue their debate over your prone form, unaware that you might still be fighting for survival...
