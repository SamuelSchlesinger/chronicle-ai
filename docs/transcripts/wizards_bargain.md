# The Wizard's Bargain

*An elf wizard seeks forbidden knowledge from a mysterious stranger.*

---

**Character:** Vaeris Moonwhisper (Elf Wizard)
**Background:** Sage
**Location:** The Dusty Archives

---

### Turn 1

**Player:** I search the ancient shelves for any texts on planar magic.

**DM:** You approach the towering shelves that line the ancient archive, their wooden frames dark with age and dust. Countless tomes, scrolls, and bound manuscripts crowd every available space, their spines bearing titles in languages both familiar and arcane.
Your trained eye quickly identifies the organizational system used in this section of the archives. Moving methodically through the shelves, you trace your finger along leather-bound spines until you discover a promising section devoted to extraplanar studies.

After several minutes of careful searching, you uncover three texts that catch your attention:

**"Fundamentals of Planar Theory"** - A well-worn primer with basic diagrams of the planes and their connections. The binding suggests frequent use by students.

**"Dimensional Rifts and Their Manifestations"** - A more advanced text bound in dark blue leather, with silver clasps. Several bookmarks protrude from its pages.

**"The Shadowfell Codex"** - An ominous black tome that seems to absorb light around it. Strange symbols are etched into its cover, and it feels unnaturally cold to the touch.
Which of these texts would you like to examine more closely, or would you prefer to continue searching for something more specific?

### Turn 2

**Player:** I examine the strange tome more closely. What language is it written in?

**DM:** You carefully lift the Shadowfell Codex from its resting place, immediately noticing how the temperature around your hands drops several degrees. The book feels heavier than it should for its size, as if it contains more than mere parchment and ink.
Your arcane training serves you well as you examine the tome's cover and binding. The primary text is written in **Abyssal**, the harsh language of demons and chaotic evil outsiders. However, interwoven throughout are passages in **Common** and what appears to be **Draconic** - suggesting this was either translated from multiple sources or compiled by someone with knowledge of several planar languages.

The strange symbols etched into the cover are **infernal runes** - not demonic Abyssal script, but the more ordered diabolic writing of the Nine Hells. This curious mixture of chaotic and lawful evil influences suggests the tome deals with multiple lower planes, not just the Shadowfell as its title implies.

As you hold the book, you notice that some of the silver clasps bear tiny engravings of what look like **gateways or portals** - circular designs with geometric patterns that seem to shift slightly when you're not looking directly at them.

The book feels ancient and powerful. Opening it might reveal valuable planar magic knowledge... but such tomes often contain more than just academic theory.

Do you wish to open the Shadowfell Codex, or would you prefer to examine one of the other texts first?

---

### Turn 3

**Player:** I attempt to read the inscription on the cover using my knowledge of arcane languages.

**DM:** You lean in close, your elven eyes tracing the intricate patterns of Abyssal, Draconic, and infernal script that wind across the tome's cover like writhing serpents. The languages shift and blur together in a way that makes your head ache slightly.

The Abyssal text seems to be the title - something about "shadows" and "crossing" - but the chaotic nature of the script makes it difficult to parse the exact meaning. The Draconic passages appear to be warnings or cautions, but the archaic dialect is unlike anything in your studies.

Most frustrating are the infernal runes. They pulse with a faint, dark energy that seems to resist your attempts to comprehend them. Each time you think you're beginning to understand a symbol, it seems to shift slightly, as if the very act of observation changes its meaning.

After several minutes of concentrated effort, you're left with only fragments: words like "gateway," "price," and "binding" scattered throughout the text, but their context remains maddeningly unclear.

The tome seems to be deliberately obscured - either enchanted to resist casual reading, or written in such archaic and specialized terminology that it requires expertise beyond your current training.

You could attempt to open the book itself, seek out the other texts for comparison, or perhaps look for reference materials that might help you decipher these inscriptions. What would you like to do?

### Turn 4

**Player:** Who approaches? I turn to face the stranger, one hand ready to cast Shield.

**DM:** You spin around, your hand instinctively moving to the component pouch at your side as your magical training kicks in. The ancient archive's silence is broken by the soft shuffle of footsteps on dusty stone.

From between the towering shelves emerges an elderly human woman, her silver hair pulled back in a practical bun and her robes marking her as a scholar or librarian. She moves with the careful gait of someone who has spent decades navigating these narrow aisles. Her eyes, sharp despite her age, immediately focus on the dark tome in your other hand.

"Ah," she says, her voice carrying a mixture of concern and familiarity, "I see you've found the Shadowfell Codex. Most visitors are drawn to the prettier volumes." She gestures toward the other texts you had discovered. "I am Keeper Miriel, guardian of these archives. That particular tome has been the subject of much... debate among our scholars."

Her gaze shifts to your ready stance and the way your hand hovers near your spell components. A knowing smile crosses her weathered features.

"Peace, young mage. I mean no harm - though I confess your interest in that particular book does give me pause. Few who handle it remain unchanged by the experience." She takes a step closer, but respectfully maintains distance. "Might I ask what draws you to such dark knowledge?"

What do you say to Keeper Miriel?

---

### Turn 5

**Player:** I listen carefully to the stranger's offer. What exactly does he want in exchange?

**DM:** I notice there might be some confusion - the person who approached you is Keeper Miriel, an elderly woman who is the guardian of these archives. She hasn't made any offer or mentioned wanting anything in exchange yet. 

She simply introduced herself, expressed concern about your interest in the Shadowfell Codex, and asked what draws you to such dark knowledge.

Are you perhaps thinking of a different conversation, or would you like to respond to Keeper Miriel's question about why you're interested in the tome? You could also ask her about the "debate" among scholars she mentioned, or inquire about the nature of the changes that happen to those who handle the book.

What would you like to say or do in response to the Keeper?

---

### Turn 6

**Player:** I consider the bargain. 'Knowledge for knowledge seems fair, but what assurance do I have?'

**DM:** Keeper Miriel tilts her head slightly, her brow furrowing with gentle confusion. She adjusts her scholarly robes and takes a small step back, clearly puzzled by your words.

"I'm afraid I don't understand, young scholar," she says, her voice carrying a note of concern. "I haven't proposed any bargain or exchange. I merely introduced myself and asked about your interest in that particular tome."

She gestures toward the Shadowfell Codex still clutched in your hands, her expression growing more worried. "Are you feeling quite alright? That book has been known to... affect those who handle it for too long. Some report hearing whispers, seeing things that aren't there, or becoming confused about conversations that haven't actually occurred."

The elderly keeper's eyes narrow with scholarly interest mixed with genuine concern. "How long have you been holding the Codex? And more importantly - have you opened it yet?"

She moves slightly closer, her hands clasped in front of her in a non-threatening manner. "Perhaps we should set the tome aside for a moment and discuss what you're truly seeking in these archives. Knowledge should be pursued safely, after all."

What do you do? Do you set down the tome as she suggests, or do something else?
